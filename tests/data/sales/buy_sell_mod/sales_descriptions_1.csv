He must also have dealt in pictures, as his name appears regularly at sales until this date.  (A few of his annotated catalogues have also survived.)  The auctioneer's (CL) copy of the present catalogue indicates that lots 1-36 were his, and that the remainder were consigned by a variety of other people, both dealers and amateurs.  Many of the paintings had failed to sell at earlier auctions and this sale was probably intended to clear out miscellaneous stock at the end of the year.  Very few lots reached Â£10.  (B.

The title page of the catalogue carries the year 1804, but no month or date is given.  However, the sale can probably be connected with an announcement in the Morning Chronicle on June 11, 1804, for an anonymous sale in Bryan's gallery of special pictures.  Since Bryan apparently sold his gallery in May of this year -- after which time it was called late Mr. Bryan's -- the present sale must have taken place after May.  No other announcements for an anonymous sale by private contract to be held in this gallery are known, and so we have assigned the date of June 11 to it.  Its duration is unknown. The printed catalogue does not provide any information about the owner, but the single extant copy is inscribed with the name Parke.  Because many of the pictures reappear in the dealer John Parke's sale of 1812, it is likely that everything in the current sale was his.  A few pictures can perhaps be traced to Michael Bryan, but they had probably been bought by Parke prior to the sale.  A significant number of the pictures also reappear in the Heathcote sale of Apr.5/6, 1805 (no.322), but since they also reappear in Parke's sale of 1812, it is fairly certain that they were his property throughout. As was characteristic of many sales by private contract, the descriptions of the individual pictures in the catalogue are exceedingly brief, with very little information about provenance.  However, a number of the pictures certainly came from the Robit and Gildemeester collections, and it can be assumed that many were of good quality.  Two have been identified:  lot 18, A Landscape with Abraham and Isaac by Domenichino, said to have come from the Orl√©ans collection, is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; and lot 36, A Portrait of a Member of the Barbarini Family by Titian, is certainly the painting now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, currently -- and erroneously -- attributed to Willem Key.  However, most of the paintings in the sale seem not to have been sold, since they subsequently appeared at auctions to which Parke was still their consigner.  (B.

They opened in 1791 under the management of John Wilson, an American, and published catalogues at irregular intervals, initially one or two per year but later perhaps as often as once a month during high season.  Some lots were sold quickly whereas others remained on view over the course of a few years. The items on sale that were not sold immediately, or were not removed for some other reason, retained their original lot numbers for periods of two years or more, allowing one to trace their presence at the gallery through new editions of the catalogue, even when the paintings were sometimes attributed to a different artist.  The present catalogue, of which only one copy is known, is the earliest from the new century and is dated 1801 on the title page. An information page at the back, which is dated October, 1801, (and changed by hand to November), indicates that tickets of admission were valid until Jan.1, 1803.  From newspaper advertisements it is known that the sale was being refreshed on Nov.16, and so we have given the sale this date.  The lots are numbered as high as 934, but over half of the numbers are lacking, presumably because they had already been sold or withdrawn by the proprietors.  The same numbering is found in the only catalogue known from the year 1800 and so the present sequence must date from early that year or in 1799.  Later European Museum catalogues from 1803 and 1804 retain the same numbering and from them one can determine which paintings remained unsold; in some cases until well into 1806. Periodically the gallery was cleared and the unsold lots removed and put up for auction with local auctioneers, initially with Charles Farebrother, but later with James Christie and others.  Many of the pictures in the present catalogue can be traced to three sales held by Farebrother in early 1804: on Feb.3/4, Mar.23/24, and May 17 (Br-232, 250 and 265).  In spite of this, the matter of ownership remains unclear.  Some of the paintings on view are known to have belonged to John Wilson, the proprietor, but the majority certainly belonged to other individual consigners.  It is still unexplained how large groups of pictures belonging to a variety of people could be transferred en bloc from the gallery to an auctioneer, but it must be presumed that at some stage Wilson obtained their permission to dispose of the unsold pictures in this manner. The later auctions provide a few clues to the identity of the principal consigner to the present and subsequent European Museum sales.  Two, and perhaps all three, of the auctions can be associated with the dealer John Humble, and evidently consisted primarily of his property. The relationship between Wilson and Humble is not yet understood, but it is certain that Humble was a major consigner to the gallery, and he may also have had a financial stake in it.  At least 92 of the lots in the present catalogue can be traced to him, and many more may have been his as well.  He seems to have dealt in rather inexpensive works, and his association with the gallery apparently did not survive much beyond 1812, although he was active in the local market until at least 1841.  It appears that in later years, after Humble had ceased consigning to the European Museum, the general level of the works on view there rose considerably, but the institution itself only survived until 1819, and no comparable gallery ever came close to taking its place.  Its special niche in the market may have been primarily that of an outlet for diverse kinds of pictures for which their owners hoped, usually in vain, to fetch prices somewhat better than might be realized at auction.  Eventually its site in King street was taken over by James Christie.   (B. Fredericksen)",yes,CATALOGUES-22,Private Contract Sale,,,,,,,,,,,

(For a discussion see Br-64.)  During this period their catalogues were issued at least two or three times a year, and since the numbering of the lots was retained from one catalogue to the next, one can deduce which lots had been sold or removed in the meantime.  Every two or three years the unsold pictures were usually put up for sale by auction and the display was changed and renumbered.  Many catalogues in the series exist in just a few copies and many others have been ompletely lost.  The present catalogue, also known from a single copy,  was preceded by Br-577 (dated May 3, 1808), which is the earliest extant catalogue from 1808 and the earliest known after the exhibition had undergone considerable change in 1807, a year from which no catalogues have been preserved.  The earlier sale consisted of 291 lots carrying numbers as high as 504, while the present catalogue includes 337 lots numbered as high as 619, reflecting a considerable expansion in the exhibition within no more than two months.  The next extant catalogue in the sequence, Br-623, dated in November of the same year, consisted of 338 lots numbered as high as 657.     As a rule the names of neither the consigners nor the buyers are known, but some of the paintings remained on exhibition for years at a time - though changing numbers every two years or so - and can be associated with specific consigners based on annotations found in other catalogues.",yes,CATALOGUES-8445,Private Contract Sale,,,,,,,,,,,

The catalogue lacks any date, but both extant copies are inscribed with the year 1812. Neither copy includes the inserted page that would have given the precise dates and other details, including the name of the auctioneer.  However, the latter was probably E.J. Terlinck, who was also the printer of the catalogue. The title page specifies that the principal consigner was the recently deceased painter Pieter Goddyn (1752-1811), but noting that there were other consigners as well.  In fact, the sale included 28 lots of pictures by Goddyn, and one can probably assume that most, if not all, of these had been part of his estate.  Many of the others can be traced to earlier sales held in Bruges, as well as to later sales, some of which were held by the same auctioneer. Unfortunately, the results of the sale are not recorded.","yes","BELGIANCATS-111","","","","","","","","","","",""

Terlinck","Terlinck (E.J.)","","","","","","","","","","","Brugge","Bruges","Belgium","Unknown","","","","","The catalogue for this sale is known only from a single copy which lacks the inserted page giving the exact dates with details about the auctioneer and payments, etc.  E.J. Terlinck was probably the auctioneer since he is identified as the printer of the catalogue.  The catalogue is dated by hand with the year and is bound with other catalogues from 1811, but neither the month or date are known.  Most probably the sale was held sometime after mid-year because the principal consigner, De Brauwere, died in 1811 and a few months would have been required to settle his estate and organize this sale.  Moreover, lot 3, a depiction of La Femme adultère by Peter van Lint, and lot 8, Fête de Village by Schoevaerts, had already appeared in Terlinck's sale of June 24, 1811 (cat. no.195), so the present sale must be at least a month or two later.  Terlinck normally held no more than four sales per year, spaced out at intervals of two or three months, so we have tentatively dated the present one in September. Because of the large size of the catalogue -- ca.120 pages -- the sale can be assumed to have lasted well over two weeks. The larger part of the sale was devoted to books with smaller sections of prints, paintings and miscellaneous objects.  The title page refers to two consigners:  Frans Lodewijk de Brauwere, a former burgermaster and magistrate from the city of Nieuport, and Pierre Pauwels, a pharmacist from Bruges.  It is not specified which of these two owned the paintings, but there were certainly other consigners as well.  As mentioned above, two lots had been left unsold at Terlinck's sale held on June 24, and lot 24, La Continence de Scipion by L. Deyster, can be traced to Terlinck's sale of May 23, 1810 (no.172), neither of which can be associated with De Brauwere or Pauwels.  And at least three paintings in the present sale reappeared in an auction held by the Veuve De Moor et Fils in Bruges on Dec.4, 1811 (no.201) which consisted of items from still other collectors.  The results of the present sale are unknown.","yes","BELGIANCATS-321","","","","","","","","","","",""
